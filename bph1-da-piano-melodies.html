(also in the hopes to make it more active) I will be rating every track on the album on a scale of 1-10 and give my thoughts about them. I will not be reading into the meanings of the songs a lot. I will just review PIANO Melodies. 67 likes.

Gold Series: Piano Melodies. Опубликовано 23.11.2018 автор Рома  Содержание: Piano Loops Размер: 394 MB. Пак сэмплов очень красивых и трогательных звуков фортепиано. Melody is G\_A\_C\_B.

Are you supposed to play the notes I decided to do a song by song reaction to the album now that I've had a chance to listen to it a few times.

Having listened to the singles as they came out, I have a little more time getting comfortable with them, so it's less of a reaction on those. Also, this is obviously short, as there are so many layers to each song.
